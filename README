AGK Changes
------------

Included is a Visual Studio 2015 project used to edit the files but this is a GCC compiled project, VS2015 calls the external build programs make.exe and gcc.exe. You will need to have these installed and in your path variable.

You will also need the GTK runtime files installed in C:\libs (or edit the makefile to point elsewhere), the runtime files used were from the all in one bundle located here http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip, note that for portability the source "bin" folder contains copies of these runtime files so end-users do not need to install them (not included on Git, copy from GTK 2.24 bundle).

Compiling on Mac isn't a fun experience if you haven't dealt with GTK before, read GeanyMacConfig.txt for details.



Geany - A fast and lightweight IDE
----------------------------------


About
-----
Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent
as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it
is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the
GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.


Features
--------
The basic features of Geany are:
- syntax highlighting
- code completion
- auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while
- auto completion of XML and HTML tags
- call tips
- folding
- many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal
- symbol lists
- embedded terminal emulation


Requirements
------------
For compiling Geany yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.16.0)
libraries and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries
and header files, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are
available at http://www.gtk.org.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; a C++
compiler is also needed for the required Scintilla library included. The
GNU versions of these tools are recommended.


Installation
------------
Installing Geany is done by the following three commands:
$ ./configure
$ make
(as root)
% make install

For more configuration details run
$ ./configure --help

If there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact the mailing list or one of
the authors.

See the manual for details (geany.txt/geany.html).


Usage
-----
To run Geany just type
$ geany
on a console or use the applications menu from your desktop environment.
There a few command line options. See the manual page of Geany or run
$ geany --help
for details. Or look into the documention in the doc/ directory.
The most important option probably is -c or --config, where you can
specify an alternate configuration directory.


Windows
-------
Geany runs also under Windows. To download the binary with all necessary
files, visit Geany's homepage. But you should know, that the Windows
version is not yet well tested and there are some features missing:
- build support (implemented but might be still buggy)
- embedded terminal emulation (VTE)


License
-------

as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the

The included Scintilla library (found in the subdirectory scintilla/)
has its own license, which can be found in the file scintilla/License.txt
included with the source code of this program.
